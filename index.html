                    Around 77 years ago, on the historic date of 15th August 1947, India became free from British
                    domination. It was the culmination of numerous movements and struggles that were rife throughout the
                    time of British rule including the historic revolt of 1857. This independence was achieved through
                    the efforts of many revolutionary freedom fighters, who took the lead in organizing the struggle
                    which led to India’s independence. This blog brings you the Indian freedom fighters who sacrificed
                    their lives to ensure India’s independence.

                    <h4>Independence Day</h4>
                    <p>
                        Independence Day 2023 Speech in English: India is celebrating its 77th year of Independence on
                        August 15th, 2023. The celebration has been titled ‘Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ by Prime Minister
                        Narendra Modi, fronted by the Ministry of Culture and the Government of India. As we gear up for
                        the biggest festival of democracy on Monday, here are a few speech ideas to help you and the
                        kids to perform and celebrate the Freedom Festival with all pomp and show
                        Independence Day is the biggest festival of democracy for all Indians. We celebrate Independence
                        Day every year on August 15 because on this day, we got freedom from British rule and elected
                        our first Prime Minister – Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. This is just not to mark our freedom from
                        the invaders who ruled the country for 200 years but also to celebrate each Indian’s right to
                        live freely and enjoy all other constitutional rights that shine gloriously in the Constitution
                        of India. India is a diverse country with 28 states, over 121 languages and 270 mother tongues
                        and Independence Day is the day to celebrate this diversity and the sprawling cultures that we
                        cherish and preserve
                        It is the day to remind all that freedom never comes easily to anyone. It is the day to remember
                        the sacrifice of the millions of freedom fighters who fought bravely against the Britishers, not
                        just to reclaim their land back, but also to fight the oppression, the elitism, the sheer
                        cruelty of their rule and various rights to debilitate Indian citizens introduced by the British
                        Raj. Also Read - Independence Day 2023: Parking Facilities at Metro Stations to Remain Shut On

                        The celebrations begin early in the morning at Delhi’s Red Fort where the Prime Minister of
                        India delivers a quick speech and addresses the nation about the development and the policies
                        that the government has introduced, and the upcoming efforts that the government has planned to
                        take to boost the nation further. Before arriving at the Red Fort, the PM also visits India Gate
                        to honour the sacrifice of our martyrs by giving a Shradhanjali. The PM then hoists the
                        tricolour flag in which each colour signifies a different spirit of the nation. While saffron
                        stands for glory and happiness, white is for peace and green is for faith. In the centre of our
                        flag, there is an Ashok chakra that contains 24 evenly distributed spikes.

                        As we celebrate the 77th Independence Day, we remember the glorious sacrifice of our freedom
                        fighters with a hand on our hearts and promise to maintain the spirit of brotherhood and peace
                        in the nation. We think about all those who are still fighting their own battles against
                        patriarchy, inequality, gender biases and poverty. We promise to contribute to our free land in
                        the best way possible.

                    <h2 style="color:blue">1.</h2> The song ‘Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata’ composed in 1911 by Nobel laureate
                    Rabindranath Tagore was renamed as ‘Jana Gana Mana’ and adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India
                    as the national anthem on January 24, 1950.

                    <br>
                    <h2 style="color:blue">2.</h2> The Indian national flag with three horizontal stripes of red, yellow
                    and green was hoisted on August 7, 1906, at Parsee Bagan Square in Kolkata. The first variant of
                    India's current national flag was designed by freedom fighter Pingali Venkayya in 1921. The current
                    flag with saffron, white and green colours and the Ashok Chakra in the middle was officially adopted
                    on July 22, 1947, and hoisted on August 15, 1947.
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="color:blue">3.</h2> Five other countries celebrate their independence on August 15 along
                    with India. They are Bahrain, North Korea, South Korea and Liechtenstein.
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="color:blue">4.</h2> The Indian flag is manufactured and supplied from only one place in
                    the nation. The Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha (KKGSS), located in Dharwad in Karnataka,
                    has the authority to manufacture and supply the Indian national flag. According to the Bureau of
                    Indian Standards (BIS), the flag is manufactured only with hand-spun and handwoven cotton khadi
                    wafting.
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="color:blue">5.</h2> Even after India's independence, Goa was still a Portuguese colony.
                    It was annexed to India by the Indian Army only in 1961. Thus, Goa was the last state to join the
                    Indian territory.

                The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the ultimate aim of ending British
                rule in India. It lasted from 1857 to 1947.

                The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later
                took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right
                to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for
                natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule by the Lal Bal
                Pal triumvirate, Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.

                                Born on 2nd October 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation
                                for his immense sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he
                                also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements
                                across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence
                                in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of
                                non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. The historic Non-Cooperation
                                movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.

                                One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than
                                Subhas Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and
                                his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose disagreed with the ideals of
                                non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust
                                the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the
                                British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian
                                National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian
                                territory from the British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese
                                surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945,
                                his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.

                                Contribution of Subhas Chandra Bose to the Independence of India is significant.
                                Just like these Indian Freedom Fighters, there are several other global heroes who laid

                                home minister and deputy prime minister of India.

                                India. This revolutionary hero was born in a Sikh family in the undivided state of

                                death. He was involved in a plot in 1928 to assassinate James Scott, a British police
